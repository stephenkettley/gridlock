# Gridlock
A memory based game I invented called Gridlock. This game was built using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS.

Users are presented with a 3x3 grid on which a sequence will flash. They are then required to repeat the sequence in the correct order.
Level 1 will flash one block, level 2 will flash 2 blocks and so on. There are infinite levels. The game ends when the user incorrectly repeats a sequence on a given level.

Have fun!
